# Matrix-multiplication-in-python
This is a python program that can multiply two matrices
Although it is a rather lengthy and slightly inefficient program it still gets the job done.
The program requires two files as command line arguments containing matrices of even dimensions.
The matrix dimensions dy default should not be less than 1 or greater than 100. However that can be changed within the program.
